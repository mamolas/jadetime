# Jade Time QR GitHub Pages

This page generates a Jade-compatible QR code to set the device time using the current UTC timestamp.

## Usage

- Deploy this repo to GitHub Pages (`main` branch or `/docs` directory).
- Open the site: it shows a QR code and a BC-UR string (scan this with Blockstream Jade).
- After unlocking your Jade device, go to **Main Menu â†’ Scan** and scan the QR code.

## How it works

- On page load, gets the current UTC timestamp.
- Encodes `{ id: <random>, method: "set_epoch", params: { epoch: <now> } }` as CBOR.
- Wraps the CBOR as BC-UR (`ur:jade-msg/...`).
- Renders as a QR code.

## Recent Fixes

- **v1.1**: Fixed parameter name from `timestamp` to `epoch` to match Jade firmware expectations.
- **v1.1**: Added required message `id` field for proper RPC communication.

## Why This is Needed

When using Jade in air-gapped mode (QR PIN or SeedQR unlock), the device doesn't have access to the current time, which is essential for Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) generation. This tool provides the missing time synchronization via QR code.

## Scanning Instructions

1. Unlock your Jade device using QR PIN or SeedQR
2. Navigate to the main menu
3. Select "Scan" option
4. Scan the QR code generated by this tool
5. Your Jade should now have the correct time for TOTP generation
